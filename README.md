# stayinn

**Work in progress üöß**  
Stayinn is a full-stack monorepo app currently under development. This app will support multiple user roles, authentication with Firebase (email, Google, phone), and data persistence via MongoDB Atlas.

---

## üß± Project Structure

This monorepo uses **Yarn Workspaces** to manage shared packages and multiple applications:

```

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup (No Docker)

> Docker is intentionally skipped during early development to speed up iteration (e.g. `yarn add`, live reload, hot module changes). Docker will be reintroduced during deployment or staging setup.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (>= 18.x)
-   Yarn (v1 or v3, depending on your setup)
-   MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB for testing)
-   Firebase project setup

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

From the root of the repo:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn install

# Start backend and frontend together
yarn dev
```

To run individual apps:

```bash
# Start backend API server
yarn workspace backend dev

# Start frontend (hosts - Next.js)
yarn workspace hosts dev
```

---

## üì¶ Shared Packages

This repo includes shared code organized in `/packages`:

-   `shared-types`: Common types and interfaces
-   `shared-auth`: Shared Firebase logic (used in frontend)

These packages are imported using TypeScript path aliases and watched during local development for hot reload.

---

## üìå Notes

-   All development is currently done **outside of Docker** for speed and simplicity.
-   Docker will be reintroduced later for staging, CI/CD, and production.
-   Firebase config and secrets should **not** be committed. Use `.env.local` files per app.

---

## üöÄ Upcoming

-   ‚úÖ Monorepo with Yarn Workspaces
-   ‚úÖ Shared type packages
-   üîú Authentication flow (email, Google, phone via Firebase)
-   üîú MongoDB persistence layer
-   üîú Email verification flow
-   üîú Session/token auth

---

## üß† Why no Docker yet?

> Docker adds overhead during rapid iteration (e.g., frequent `yarn add`, file watching, rebuilds). It also creates duplication between host and container `node_modules`, which can be cumbersome early on.
> We'll reintroduce Docker once the project reaches a stable milestone (e.g., production API, frontend routes, CI pipelines).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

-   Next.js
-   Node.js / Express
-   Firebase Auth SDK
-   MongoDB Atlas
-   TypeScript
-   TailwindCSS + daisyUI
-   Yarn Workspaces
-   Amazon S3
